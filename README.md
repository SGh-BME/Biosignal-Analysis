# EEG Bispectrum Analysis

This repository provides Python code for bispectral analysis and
bispectrum-based feature extraction of EEG signals during motor
planning and execution tasks.

## Overview
The code implements:
- Bispectrum computation
- Cross-frequency phase coupling features
- Feature extraction pipelines for EEG classification tasks

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- MNE-Python

## Usage
Example scripts demonstrating bispectrum computation and feature
extraction are provided in the repository.

## Data Availability
Due to IRB and participant privacy restrictions, raw EEG data are not
publicly shared. The code can be applied to any preprocessed EEG dataset.

## Citation
If you use this code, please cite the associated publication and this
repository.
